<h2 align="center">Potix License Agreement for Early Release of Programs</h2>
<p>
BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, COPYING, ACCESSING, OR USING THE PROGRAM YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF ANOTHER PERSON OR A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE FULL AUTHORITY TO BIND THAT PERSON, COMPANY, OR LEGAL ENTITY TO THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, COPY, ACCESS, OR USE THE PROGRAM.
</p><p>
"Early Release" means that the Program is not formally released or commercially available. The term does not imply that the Program will be formally released or made commercially available. Potix does not warrant that should a Program be formally released or made commercially available that it will be similar to, or compatible with, Early Release versions.
</p><p>
"Potix" is Potix Corporation.
</p><p>
"Program" is the following, including the original and all whole or partial copies: 1) machine-readable instructions and data, 2) components, 3) audio-visual content (such as images, text, recordings, or pictures), 4) related licensed materials, and 5) license use documents or keys, and documentation.
</p><p>
"You" and "Your" refer either to an individual person or to a single legal entity.
</p><p>
This Agreement is the complete agreement between You and Potix regarding the use of the Program. It replaces any prior oral or written communications between You and Potix concerning Your use of the Program. 
</p>
<h3>1.	Entitlement</h3>
<p>
License
</p><p>
The Program is owned by Potix, and is copyrighted and licensed, not sold.
</p><p>
Potix grants You a nonexclusive license to use the Program when You lawfully acquire it.
</p><p>
You may make and install a reasonable number of copies, including a backup copy, of the Program to support such use. The terms of this license apply to each copy You make. You will reproduce all copyright notices and all other legends of ownership on each copy, or partial copy, of the Program.
</p><p>
THE PROGRAM MAY CONTAIN A DISABLING DEVICE THAT WILL PREVENT IT FROM BEING USED AFTER THE EVALUATION PERIOD ENDS. YOU WILL NOT TAMPER WITH THIS DISABLING DEVICE OR THE PROGRAM. YOU SHOULD TAKE PRECAUTIONS TO AVOID ANY LOSS OF DATA THAT MIGHT RESULT WHEN THE PROGRAM CAN NO LONGER BE USED.
</p><p>
You will 1) maintain a record of all copies of the Program and 2) ensure that anyone who uses the Program (accessed either locally or remotely) does so only for Your authorized use and complies with the terms of this Agreement.

You may not 1) use, copy, modify or distribute the Program except as provided in this Agreement; 2) reverse assemble, reverse compile, or otherwise translate the Program except as specifically permitted by law without the possibility of contractual waiver; or 3) sublicense, rent, or lease the Program.
</p><p>
The evaluation period begins when You agree to the terms of this Agreement and ends 1) when the Program automatically disables itself, or 2) when Potix makes the program commercially available. You will destroy the Program and all copies made of it within ten days of the end of the evaluation period. There is no charge for the use of Program for the duration of the evaluation period.
</p><p>
Potix may terminate Your license if You fail to comply with the terms of this Agreement. If Potix does so, You must destroy all copies of the Program.
